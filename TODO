TODO (unprioritized)
-------------------    
* Provide a commandline-option to specify an edit-distance value,
  and only suggestions with exactly specified distance would be shown.
* Provide an option for the user to specify number of suggestions to show
  (regardless of edit-distance)
* Expand this one to read and spell-check an entire text document
* Support looking up into more than one dictionaries
* Instead of a rigid default threshold, adjust the threshold 
  or the number of suggestions automatically
* Make separate Makefile target - debug
* Make separate Makefile target - unittest
* ONGOING - Meaningful comments


DONE
----
