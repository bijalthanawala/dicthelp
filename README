Start Date: 16th Dec 2011
Language: C


Usage: dicthelp [OPTION]... [word]

Refers the dictionary and suggests correctly spelled words(s) for a given 
(misspelled) word. If the word is not supplied on the command-line, it is 
read through stdin

Options:
        -d <dictionary>
           Specify name of the dictionary to look up the
           word/suggestions into
           *Default dictionary = /usr/share/dict/words
        -s <r|a>
           Set sort order of the output
           r  sorts suggested words according to the relevancy (edit-distance)
           a  sorts suggested words alphabetically
           *Default sort order = r
        -f Force suggestions.
           Show suggestions (similarly spelled words) even if the supplied 
           word is spelled correctly.
           *By default -f is not in effect.
        -v Enable verbose output   
        -h Show this help
Advanced Options:
        -e n
           Set max edit-distance threshold.
           n is edit-distance (a numeric value).
           Only suggestions with edit-distance less than or equal to n will 
           be shown. Higher the value of n, more the suggestions (with reducing 
           relevancy)
           *Default edit-distance threshold =  2
 SOME EXAMPLES:
 dicthelp happyness
 dicthelp -e3 happyness
 dicthelp -e3 -sa happyness
 dicthelp -e1 -f happy
